# Povitica

## Introduction

Povitica is a traditional South Slavic pastry. In the US, it and pastry's like
it are generically referred to as nut rolls. This is because povitica is typically made by spreading a filling containing walnuts over a flattened
sheet of yeast dough, rolling it up, and baking it.

# Description

In additiona to walnuts, the povitica filling can have cream cheese, rasins,
plums, honey, cinnamon, and brown sugar. The dough itself can be normal salt-yeast-water-flour, or more complicated with honey and cinnamon added in for extra flavor and food for the yeast.

It not as sweet as other pastries since the filling does not typically have a lot of refined sugar in it.

It can hold for months when frozen, and goes well toasted and covered in butter or cream cheese.

# Etymology

My family recipe list both 'potica' and 'povatica', but I believe the second
to be an error as all sources I have found use 'povitica'. 

A similar, but distincly different pastry is 'orahnjaƒça', although the name may be used interchangeably in Croatia.

# Cultural significance

In the homeland, povitica was and still is prepared both as a daily staple, as well as for special occasion ssuch as weddings and holidays. These practices continue in Croatian diaspora communities in the US and elsewhere.

Family recipes for povitica are often passed down as a link to the homeland. I have a recipe from my great grandfather who was a Croatian imigrant.

Giving a loaf of povitica to someone or their family is a sign of freindship and trust.
