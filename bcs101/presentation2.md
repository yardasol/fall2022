# Croatian national football team (Hrvatsak nogometna reprezentacija)

## History
Pre WWII, Croatians played as part of the national team for the Kington of Yugoslavia.

During WWII, the (facist puppet) Independed State of Croatia fielded a national
team, and played 14 FIFA-recognized matches.

Post-war, Croatians played for the national team of the Federal People's
Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as an (unoffical) Croatian national team in
international freindly matches.

The modern Croatian national football team, including the iconic checkered
jersey, came about briefly before it declared independence from Yugoslavia.
From 1990 til late 1991, Croatia fielded a de facto national team in
international friendly games.

Post-independence, Croatia joined FIFA (1992) (the first time it had done so
since WWII), and UEFA (1993), but too late to participate in the 1994 World Cup.
